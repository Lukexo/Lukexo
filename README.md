Welcome to my profile, I'm the founder of Octavia Labs and the lead developer on Octavia, the advanced AI assistant designed to read, write, and automate your tasks across web3.

## About Me
I'm an innovator and builder with a passion for impact. I strive to build things that can change the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. 

I have an extensive background in DeFi, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology. In 2020, I co-founded Bogged Finance and built it from the ground up. We grew it from nothing to $2.6 billion total traded volume with 300,000 total dapp users and reached 3 million monthly active users on our charting platform in just a year.

Currently, I'm building Octavia, the world's first semi-autonomous AI assistant, at Octavia Labs. It's ambitious and challenging, but we're already further ahead than anyone else in the industry.

## Octavia Labs

Octavia Labs is a diverse team I lead, focused on building the next generation of AI assistants to power the future of Web3 and the Internet. With Octavia, we aim to simplify the complex world of blockchain and cryptocurrency, making it more accessible and easy to navigate.

Octavia is designed to enhance productivity, conduct extensive research, and access on-chain information. She learns about your preferences over time and can make transactions on the blockchain.

You can learn more about Octavia on our [official website](https://octavia.one), and take a moment to visit our [Github Repository](https://github.com/Octavia-Labs).
